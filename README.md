# SIMPO-algorithm
The algorithm is related to the research *Mining the Selective Remodeling of DNA Methylation in Promoter Regions to Identify Robust Gene-Level Associations with Phenotype*. In this study, we have proposed the statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other Body Region (SIMPO) algorithm to mining gene-level DNA methylation associations with phenotype.</br>

### Quick Start

#### Python

The project code depends on the `scipy` module to run, use the `pip` command to install:

```python
pip install scipy
```

you can run it by the following command:

```python
python ./SIMPO-algorithm.py
```

The result is output to the `./result` directory



Code implementation instructions:

1. Input file: xxx1, xxx2.

2. Output file: xxx3, xxx4, xxx5.

The final output file xxx5 contains the SIMPO score of each gene in all samples
