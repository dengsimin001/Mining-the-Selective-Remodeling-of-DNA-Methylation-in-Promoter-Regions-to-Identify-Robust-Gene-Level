# SIMPO-algorithm
The algorithm is related to Mining the Selective Remodeling of DNA Methylation in Promoter Regions to Identify Robust Gene-Level Associations with Phenotype. In this study, we have proposed the statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other Body Region (SIMPO) algorithm to mining gene-level DNA methylation associations with phenotype.
